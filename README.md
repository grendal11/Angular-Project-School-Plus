**School Plus** is web application for organizing and managing school groups of interests, activities, events(competitions, meetings etc...). The app is with Bulgarian interface.

**There are two types of users:**
-	**Registered users** – can add events, subscribe and unsubscribe for events

- everybody can see the lists of open events and detailed information for each event


**Next steps** (will be implemented soon):

**Back-end**: the app uses modified by me rest-api, used in SoftUni Angular course - match 2022.



**Technology stack:**
-	Angular: ~13.3.0,
-   Design: custom CSS,
-	For DB and authentication - mongo/express rest-api
